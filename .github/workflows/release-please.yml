# This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to automate the release process for a Node.js project.
# It triggers on push events, except for pushes to the main branch. The workflow utilizes the Release Please Action
# to automatically generate release PRs, manage versioning, and update changelogs based on conventional commit messages.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - A GitHub secret named TOKEN_GITHUB with the Github credentials as it's value.
